# World_Weather_Analysis
Gather weather data to plot for a travel company.  
The ultimate aim is to build an app the for users to plan their travel itinerary. This analysis prepares
a database of random cities around the world, finds a hotel nearby and drops a marker on a map with a pop-up
that shows the hotel name and current weather.  It also produces a driving map with four cities, chosen by the user based
on their criteria, marked.
